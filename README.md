# Memory-Game

Simple Memory games with 12 buttons, with pairs of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 

Choose a pair of buttons and try again if they are not identical, by clicking on 'TRY AGAIN' button. 

If they are identical, you may proceed to find another pair of numbers which is same.

You win when you managed to open all 12 numbers.

Click 'RESTART' for new game or if you wish to restart it.

<h2> Approach </h2>

This is my first game created using Javascript, CSS and HTML. The whole idea is to have a feel of how it 
is like to create a game. This will certainly aid in future new development of other more interactive games.

The learning process supercedes all other aspects of the purposes of this game, so creating a very challenging 
first game was not the objective. 

<h2> Technology Used </h2>
  
DOM Manipulation using vanilla JS and some fundamental JS structures to create the loops and events. 
  
<h2> Difficulties Faced </h2>
  
The pseudo coding process was not implemented well, which lead to many bugs along the way. The expected events
were not triggered in sequence, leading to extra time taken to complete it.
  
The checkNum function was the part which requires the most debugging works, but its a nice learning process.

<h2> Further Improvements </h2>
  
Certainly there are plenty of rooms for improvements, and these are the following:
  
  1. Remove the 'TRY AGAIN' button and make the numbers disappear automatically if they are wrong.
  
  2. Some interactions after the game finishes, like for example 'YOU WIN' message. 
  
  3. Tracking system to determine how many attempts were done in each round.
  
  4. Expending it to 10 numbers on a 4 X 5 grid.
  
  5. Beautify the layout and outlook of the whole game.
